            Basketball is, in my opinion, the best activity I can do with my friends to have fun and burn off some energy. 
            <strong>Instead of spending the entire day on the couch playing video games or watching television, I believe that playing basketball is a pleasant and simple way to pass the time.</strong> 
            Basketball is one of my favorite sports because you can play it alone or with teammates and you don't need any equipment. <strong>I prefer playing with others to playing alone.</strong>
